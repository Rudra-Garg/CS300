# .env file for Fog/Edge Simulation Latency Configuration

# --- Master Switch ---
# Set to "true" to enable latency simulation, "false" to disable.
ENABLE_LATENCY=true

# --- Latency Values ---
# Define latency for different network links.
# Format: <value>ms (e.g., 50ms, 10ms)
# These values represent ONE-WAY delay added by the sender.

# Delay added by Mobile device when sending to its Gateway
LATENCY_MOBILE_TO_GATEWAY=50ms

# Delay added by Gateway device when sending to the Proxy
LATENCY_GATEWAY_TO_PROXY=100ms

# Delay added by Proxy device when sending to the Cloud
LATENCY_PROXY_TO_CLOUD=300ms

# --- Optional: Jitter ---
# Add random variation to the delay (e.g., 5ms means delay +/- 5ms)
# Uncomment and set values if needed. Keep them commented out for simple delay.
JITTER_MOBILE_TO_GATEWAY=5ms
JITTER_GATEWAY_TO_PROXY=10ms
JITTER_PROXY_TO_CLOUD=30ms

# --- Optional: Packet Loss ---
# Add random packet loss percentage. Use with caution.
# Uncomment and set values if needed.
LOSS_MOBILE_TO_GATEWAY=5%
LOSS_GATEWAY_TO_PROXY=5%
LOSS_PROXY_TO_CLOUD=2%



# --- Placement Strategy ---
# Options: "mobile_only", "gateway_only", "ewmp", "gvmp_mobile_preference", "gvmp_gateway_preference"
PLACEMENT_STRATEGY=ewmp # Default to EWMP for this example
# For EWMP/GVMP, simulate mobile device load
MOBILE_CPU_LIMIT=0.2 # Corresponds to 'cpus' limit in deploy section (e.g., 0.2 = 20%)
MOBILE_LOAD_THRESHOLD=0.8 # Offload if simulated CPU load > 80% of limit

# --- Cloud Offload (Optional) ---
# Used potentially by Gateway in EWMP/GVMP if gateway is overloaded
ENABLE_CLOUD_OFFLOAD=false # Set to true to enable possibility of cloud offload
GATEWAY_CPU_LIMIT=0.5 # Corresponds to 'cpus' limit in deploy section
GATEWAY_LOAD_THRESHOLD=0.9 # Forward to cloud if gateway load > 90% of limit
CLOUD_ENDPOINT=http://cloud/ # Internal Docker service name
