# .env file for Fog/Edge Simulation Latency Configuration

# --- Master Switch ---
# Set to "true" to enable latency simulation, "false" to disable.
ENABLE_LATENCY=true

# --- Latency Values ---
# Define latency for different network links.
# Format: <value>ms (e.g., 50ms, 10ms)
# These values represent ONE-WAY delay added by the sender.

# Delay added by Mobile device when sending to its Gateway
LATENCY_MOBILE_TO_GATEWAY=50ms

# Delay added by Gateway device when sending to the Proxy
LATENCY_GATEWAY_TO_PROXY=100ms

# Delay added by Proxy device when sending to the Cloud
LATENCY_PROXY_TO_CLOUD=300ms

# --- Optional: Jitter ---
# Add random variation to the delay (e.g., 5ms means delay +/- 5ms)
# Uncomment and set values if needed. Keep them commented out for simple delay.
JITTER_MOBILE_TO_GATEWAY=5ms
JITTER_GATEWAY_TO_PROXY=10ms
JITTER_PROXY_TO_CLOUD=30ms

# --- Optional: Packet Loss ---
# Add random packet loss percentage. Use with caution.
# Uncomment and set values if needed.
# LOSS_MOBILE_TO_GATEWAY=5%
# LOSS_GATEWAY_TO_PROXY=5%
# LOSS_PROXY_TO_CLOUD=2%

# --- Module Placement Levels ---
# Defines the *highest* module level to execute on this tier.
# 0 = Passthrough (Gateway/Proxy only)
# 1 = Client (Mobile only - always runs)
# 2 = Calculator
# 3 = Connector
# Example: Mobile=1, Gateway=2, Proxy=3 -> Client on Mobile, Calc on Gateway, Connector on Proxy
# Example: Mobile=2, Gateway=0, Proxy=3 -> Client+Calc on Mobile, Gateway Passthrough, Connector on Proxy
# Example: Mobile=3, Gateway=0, Proxy=0 -> Client+Calc+Connector on Mobile, Gateway/Proxy Passthrough
